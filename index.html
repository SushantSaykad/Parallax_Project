        Summary for Portfolio Website: I am a versatile and enthusiastic learner
        with a strong foundation in various technical domains. My key expertise
        includes C++, front-end web development, and a wide array of technical
        skills encompassing HTML, CSS, OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming), Data
        Structures, Algorithms, DBMS (Database Management Systems), SQL,
        Computer Networking, Git, Github, Visual Studio, Bootstrap, and
        JavaScript.<br />
        <br />
        During my internship at Oasis Infobyte in February 2022, I honed my
        skills in web development and designing, gaining proficiency in HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. This experience has further enriched my web
        development capabilities. <br />
        <br />
        One of my notable projects is the creation of my own Portfolio Website,
        developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project was
        not only a demonstration of my front-end development skills but also an
        exercise in making websites responsive. You can explore this project by
        visiting [Portfolio Website](https://sushantsaykad.github.io/portfolio/)
        on GitHub Pages.<br />
        <br />
        In addition to my projects and skills, I have achieved commendable
        ratings on HackerRank, including a 5-star rating in CPP (C++), 2-star
        rating in Problem Solving, and a 3-star rating in SQL, reflecting my
        proficiency in programming and problem-solving.<br />
        My passion for continuous learning drives me to explore new technologies
        and expand my skill set. I am committed to leveraging my expertise to
        contribute to innovative projects and challenges in the field of
        computer science and web development.
